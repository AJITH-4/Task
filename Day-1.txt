Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?
HTTP Stand for HyperText Transfer Protocol
http1.1 was created in 1997 and http2 was created in 2015
HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.
http1.1 works on the textual format and http2 works on the binary protocol
In http1.1 head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
In http2 It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests
In http1.1 compresses data by itself and in http2 It uses HPACK for data compression.
Small files load more quickly than large ones. To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.
HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.
HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
Increased security – Web browsers only support HTTP/2 via encrypted connections, increasing user and application security.
